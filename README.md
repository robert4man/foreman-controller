# Foreman Controller repo

## Overview

This is a puppet controller repo intended for use with the foreman-demo repo.
It is based on the PuppetLabs control-repo:
https://github.com/puppetlabs/control-repo

The demo repo will source this repo initially. If you want to use this repo for
testing you will need to copy this repo into your own git following the
instructions from the PuppetLabs control-repo and modify the value of 'remote'
in /etc/r10k.yaml on the master node.
